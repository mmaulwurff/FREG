/** \mainpage About

FREG is a free-roaming elementary game.
Inspired by Minecraft and Angband.
This is a version of FREG with text graphics.

Development stage: implementing basics.

Language: C++11, Qt (version >=5.2)

Non-standard libraries: libncurses5

Development is run on GNU/Linux, but on MS Windows should work too with
PDCurses ( http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/ ).

Now only singleplayer is developed, multiplayer is planned.

Compiling ----------------------------------------------------------------------

qmake freg-nox.pro;
make;

Or open freg-nox with QtCreator.

Map editing --------------------------------------------------------------------

You can edit map.txt files in your text editor.
map.txt should be square, with CR line endings only.
There is Vim highlight file fregMap.vim. You can copy it in ~/.vim/syntax and
set file type with command:
:set filetype=fregMap
Also on large maps try option
:set nowrap
Extra fun: block copy (Ctrl-v, then select, then p) and block paste (1vp).
