freg text screen visuals
========================

In game various things are represented with ASCII symbols.
For example, # is solid, ~ is liquid, and @ is some creature.
To know more about thing you see, just step up to it.

Various substances are represented with colors.
You can tune your terminal color scheme for better
appearance.

If you want game to use only ASCII symbols (for example,
instead of health hearths), use -a key at game startup.
